# Basic Command-Line Operations on HDFS
The Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) provides a set of command-line tools to interact with the file system. This guide will cover the most common operations you'll need to manage files and directories in HDFS, including uploading, downloading, deleting, renaming, and changing replication factors.

## 1. Uploading Files to HDFS
To upload files from your local filesystem to HDFS, you can use the `put` or `copyFromLocal` command.

**Command**:
```bash
hdfs dfs -put <local-path> <hdfs-destination-path>
```
Or
```bash
hdfs dfs -copyFromLocal <local-path> <hdfs-destination-path>
```
**Example**:
```bash
hdfs dfs -put /home/user/data/input.txt /user/hadoop/input/
```

This command uploads `input.txt` from the local directory `/home/user/data/` to the HDFS directory `/user/hadoop/input/`.

## 2. Downloading Files from HDFS
To download files from HDFS to your local filesystem, you can use the `get` or `copyToLocal` command.

**Command**:
```bash
hdfs dfs -get <hdfs-source-path> <local-destination-path>
```
Or
```bash
hdfs dfs -copyToLocal <hdfs-source-path> <local-destination-path>
```
**Example**:
```bash
hdfs dfs -get /user/hadoop/output/part-00000 /home/user/output/
```

## 3. Creating Directories in HDFS

To create a directory in HDFS, use the mkdir command.

**Command**:
```bash
hdfs dfs -get <hdfs-source-path> <local-destination-path>
```
**Example**:
```bash
hdfs dfs -mkdir /user/hadoop/new_dir/
```

## 4. Deleting Files and Directories in HDFS
To delete files or directories in HDFS, use the rm or rm -r command.

**Command to delete a file**:
```bash
hdfs dfs -rm <hdfs-file-path>
```
**Example**:
```bash
hdfs dfs -rm /user/hadoop/input/input.txt
```
This command deletes the file `input.txt` from the HDFS directory `/user/hadoop/input/`.

**Command to delete a directory**:
```bash
hdfs dfs -rm -r <hdfs-directory-path>
```
**Example**:
```bash
hdfs dfs -rm -r /user/hadoop/input/
```
This command deletes the entire directory /user/hadoop/input/ and all its contents.

## 5. Renaming Files and Directories in HDFS
To rename files or directories in HDFS, use the `mv` command.

**Command**:
```bash
hdfs dfs -mv <hdfs-source-path> <hdfs-destination-path>
```
**Example**:
```bash
hdfs dfs -mv /user/hadoop/input/input.txt /user/hadoop/input/renamed_input.txt
```
This command renames `input.txt` to `renamed_input.txt` within the same directory.

## 6. Listing Files and Directories in HDFS

To list files and directories in HDFS, use the `ls` command.

**Command**:
```bash
hdfs dfs -ls <hdfs-path>
```
**Example**:
```bash
hdfs dfs -ls /user/hadoop/input/
```

This command lists all files and directories within `/user/hadoop/input/`.

## 7. Changing the Replication Factor of Files and Directories
The replication factor in HDFS determines how many copies of a file are stored across the cluster. To change the replication factor, use the `setrep` command.

**Command**:
```bash
hdfs dfs -setrep -w <replication-factor> <hdfs-path>
```
 - `-w`: Wait for the command to complete before returning (ensures that the replication change is fully applied).

**Example**:
```bash
hdfs dfs -setrep -w 3 /user/hadoop/input/input.txt
```
To change the replication factor of an entire directory and its contents:
```bash
hdfs dfs -setrep -w -R 3 /user/hadoop/input/
```
 - `-R`: Applies the replication factor change recursively to all files within the directory.

# Conclusion

These basic HDFS commands will help you manage files and directories effectively within the Hadoop Distributed File System. Whether you're uploading data, managing replication, or organizing your files, these operations are essential for maintaining and utilizing an HDFS cluster.
