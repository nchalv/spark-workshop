The second part of this session will focus on encouraging participants to utilise the tools and techniques presented so far to perform data analytics on a real data set.

## Data description
### Main data set
#### _Crime Data from 2010 to 2019_ (Los Angeles) 
The "Crime Data from 2010 to 2019" dataset on the Los Angeles Open Data Portal offers a comprehensive record of crimes reported across the City of Los Angeles over the decade. Compiled from Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) reports, this dataset includes detailed information on various types of crimes, such as violent crimes, property crimes, and other offenses. Each entry in the dataset provides specific details such as the type of crime, the date and time it occurred, and the general location (to the nearest hundred block) where it was reported.

The data has been carefully anonymized to protect individual privacy, meaning that certain fields, such as exact addresses or victim information, are not disclosed. However, it is still granular enough to allow for meaningful analysis of crime patterns and trends over time. Researchers, policymakers, and community members can use this data to identify areas with higher crime rates, study the effectiveness of crime prevention strategies, and assess changes in public safety.

The dataset is also valuable for creating visualizations, such as crime heat maps, and for conducting temporal analyses to see how crime rates fluctuate over different times of the year or in response to various interventions. By making this data publicly available, the City of Los Angeles aims to promote transparency and empower residents and researchers with the information needed to enhance community safety and resilience.

For more detailed information, including the meaning of each of the 28 attributes of the data set,  you can access the dataset directly on the [Los Angeles Open Data Portal](https://data.lacity.org/Public-Safety/Crime-Data-from-2010-to-2019/63jg-8b9z/about_data).
You can directly download the data set using the information provided [here](https://github.com/nchalv/spark-workshop/blob/main/data/la_crime_data/source.txt).

### Complimentary data sets 
#### 1. _Median Household Income by Zip Code - 2015 (Los Angeles County)_
This small data-set that contains data about the average income per household and Zip Code in the region of the Los
Angeles County. The data have been collected through census and are offered by the [Los Angeles Almanac webpage](http://www.laalmanac.com/employment/em12c_2015.php).

#### 2. _Reverse Geocoding_
The term “geocoding” usually refers to the translation of an address into a location in a coordinate system. The reverse process, i.e., mapping a pair of coordinates to
an address, is known as “reverse geocoding”. Within the scope of the project, there will be a need to map coordinates (latitude, longitude) to ZIP codes within the city of Los Angeles. This
can be achieved programmatically using the assistance of web services known as geocoders and libraries such as [geopy](https://geopy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/##module-geopy.geocoders). However, the process is slow due to the latency of web services.
Therefore, a data-set with reverse geocoding information covering locations within the city of Los Angeles is provided to you.

#### 3. _List of Ethnic Groups and their codes_
This small data set can be used to match the code that refers to crime victim's descent to the ethnic group they belong to.

All data sets are available in `.csv` file format.

## Queries
### Query 1
Find, for each year, the top-3 months with highest number of recorded crimes committed. You are asked to print the month, year, number of criminal acts recorded, as well as the ranking of the month within the respective year. Results are expected to be sorted in ascending order with respect to the year and descending order with respect to the number of crimes. The following table shows the expected output format.


| year | month | crime_total | #   |
|------|-------|-------------|-----|
| 2010 | 2     | 2145        | 1   |
| 2010 | 3     | 1342        | 2   |
| 2010 | 11    | 937         | 3   |
| 2011 | 12    | 2232        | 1   |
| 2011 | 4     | 1928        | 2   |
| 2011 | 6     | 1023        | 3   |


### Query 2
Sort the different parts of the day taking into account crimes that were committed on the (`STREET`), in descending order. Consider the following pars of the day:
 - Morning: 5.00am – 11.59am  
 - Afternoon: 12.00pm – 4.59pm
 - Evening: 5.00pm – 8.59pm
 - Night: 9.00pm – 3.59am

After reading the data in a DataFrame, solve both using the DataFrame and RDD apis.


### Query 3
Find the descent of the victims of recorded crimes in Los Angeles for the year 2015 in the 3 ZIP Code areas with the highest and the 3 ZIP Codes with the lowest income per household.Results are expected to be printed from highest to lowest number of victims per ethnic group.

| Victim Descent         | #   |
|------------------------|-----|
| White                  | 413 |
| Black                  | 274 |
| Unknown                | 132 |
| Hispanic/Latin/Mexican | 12  |

Provide one table for the top 3 and another for the bottom 3 ZIP Code areas in terms of income.
